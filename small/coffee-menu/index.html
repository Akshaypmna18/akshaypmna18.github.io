            <h2 class="hover-red">Do you agree?</h2>
            <div id="health">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual
                levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4
                cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a
                possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were
                complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.

                <h2 class="hover-orange">TYPES</h2>
                <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees
                    from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging
                    from shrubs to trees.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Types of bean. </span>There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta.
                            Arabica originates from
                            Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type
                            worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the
                            environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees
                            Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to
                            disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It
                            can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.

                        <p><span>Types of roast. </span>Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to
                            produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with
                            coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to
                            medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the
                            higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter
                            roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><span>Types of grind. </span>A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip
                            coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the
                            oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Decaffeintated coffee. </span>This is an option for those who experience unpleasant
                            side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee
                            is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas.
                            Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents
                            bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to
                            U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated
                            label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss
                            of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique
                            flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.

                            beans. Most
                            of their coffee beans are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who

                            somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does not have the signature burnt
                            taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.</p>
